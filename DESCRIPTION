Description: 
    Recodes and scores the eight scales of the RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) 
    from raw item responses in a data frame. Items are recoded to a 0-100 scale and averaged 
    to create the eight health domains: Physical Functioning, Role Limitations due to 
    Physical Health, Role Limitations due to Emotional Problems, Energy/Fatigue, 
    Emotional Well-Being, Social Functioning, Pain, and General Health. This implementation 
    follows the official RAND scoring manual.
