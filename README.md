**Recode and scale the RAND SF-36 Questionnaire**

The `rand36sf` package recodes and scores the eight scales of the RAND SF-36 Health Survey from raw item responses in a data frame. Items are recoded to a 0-100 scale and averaged to create the eight scales: Physical Functioning, Role Limitations due to Physical Health, Role Limitations due to Emotional Problems, Energy/Fatigue, Emotional Well-Being, Social Functioning, Pain, and General Health. This is done as per the [scoring manual](https://www.rand.org/health/surveys/mos/36-item-short-form/scoring.html).
